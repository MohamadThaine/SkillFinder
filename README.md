# SkillFinder

People often spend their time doing nothing to improve their skills in something they like, 
or they have a hard time looking for a way to earn a living. Which is why I'm making 
my website “SkillFinder”. With the help of my website, people can have an easier time 
finding apprenticeships that they see fit for themselves. By participating in apprenticeships, 
people can earn certificates if the apprenticeship provides it and gain experience. It will 
help them have a better chance to work in an area that interests them and earn a living. The 
website is also a chance for Apprenticeship Owners to make their apprenticeships more 
known via advertising through my website
